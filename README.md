#  Sampatti  

### A secure layer added on the market place

## Why we need Sampatti ?

-  Buying home is a general necessasity for anyone and if you are buying a home, you must be sure that there shouldn't be anykind of curruption associated with that. So to make the housing industry corruption free we are here with the idea of SAMPATTI.

## What is Sampatti ?

- Sampatti is a decentralized metaverse like environment where you can check or verify the ownership of anyland, not just by the legal papers but also the
the nft ownership of that property.

- Sampatti provides you multiple features like:
  - visit and explore the user friendly space where you can visit places you know without a hassle.
  - create NFTs of your assets( Housing Property ) with the on chain decentralized verification sytem.
  - Become a legal document validator and make a active contribution in securing the space and managing this decentralized layer of  security.
  - Verify the owenership of any asset in just a sigle click.
  
  
## Why there is a need of creating an NFT?
- To be sure that there is not anykind of loopholes in the legal system we are adding an NFT layer of security, here we are not saying that now  you  don't have to go through the legal system, but we are saying that you just have to create an NFT and make sure that after that there wil be an digitak unique copy of your physical asset on the blockchain and you can be sure that there will be no change with the ownership on NFT wthout your consent.


## How we are Verifying the legal documents ?
- We have a decentralized document verification organization on our Dapp.
- We have users that acts as VALIDATORS and helps in securig the docs verification process on the Dapp.

### How to become a validator ? 
  - You just have to Stake the Native Tokens of our Sampatti Dapp which is " SPTToken " . We are following the ethreum protocol that the more you stake         more the value of your say in the environment.
### What for the bad practicers ?
   - We are slashsing the validators who validate the docs in the wrong way, this is for maintaing and realizing the power validators have in their hand and  they must be careful while using them.

## Is this is same as that of other NFT buying Marketplace?

- ### NO this is not a Marketplace 
   - This is s community where we all are activily putting efforts to make the housing industry free from corruption.
   - Currently there is no Method of buying property because buying just an NFT is not the case, housing industry is much diffrent beacuse we required may      different types of deeds for buying and selling of an property.

## Future Scope !!
  - We are going to include other maps and better Metaverse Experience for enhancing the USER EXPERIENCE !
  - We may inclue the buying/ selling system after adding a decentralized legal entity
  - We may include push protocols for adding a chatting system in the environment and better communication
  - We are gonna include Arcana for gamail wallet addressing so that there will be no anykind of obstacle for web3 onboarding.
